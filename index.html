<h4>Bill Gates</h4>
<p>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and writer best known for co-founding the software company Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[a] He was a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

    Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive.
    
    In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.</p>

<h5>MITS Altair 8800</h5>
<p>Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) 
    to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[36] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written 
    code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they
     developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; 
     it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[37] and Gates took a leave of absence from
      Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first 
      office was in Albuquerque.</p>

 <h5>Climate change and energy</h5>
 <p>Gates considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues. He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and 
    development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas
     emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices.[107] In 2011, he said: "If you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents 
     or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, I'd pick the energy thing." In 2015, he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world's
      energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources.</p>

 <h5>Green technologies to market</h5>
 <p>Gates spearheaded two initiatives that he announced at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. One was Mission Innovation,
     in which 20 national governments pledged to double their spending on research and development for carbon-free energy in over five years' time.
      Another initiative was Breakthrough Energy, a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. Gates, 
      who had already invested $1 billion of his own money in innovative energy startups, committed a further $1 billion to Breakthrough Energy.
       In December 2020, he called for the U.S. federal government to create institutes for clean energy research, analogous to the National Institutes of Health.
        Gates has also urged rich nations to shift to 100% synthetic beef industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production.</p>

<h5>Post-Microsoft</h5>
<p>Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 to become technology advisor at the firm to support 
    newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.

    Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in an interview that was published in the March 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. 
    In the interview, he provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them,
     and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "there'll be 
     some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you 
     didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced 
     that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[63] Gates has often expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence.</p>
